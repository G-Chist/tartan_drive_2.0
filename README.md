# tartan_drive_2.0

Documentation is in progress, but the data is now publicly available!

To download, run the tartandrive_gui.py script. This will allow you to click through different runs and download either the rosbags, or datasets in a KITTI format. If you only want a few specific modalities, it is suggested to download the dataset form to save space.

Our data collection scripts and metadata system is also available (more details in the repo), which allows you to streamline your data collection framework into one launch command that also associates metadata with it.
