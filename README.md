# tartan_drive_2.0

We are currently working on uploading all the data into a publicly accessible location, in the meantime a sample bag and resulting processed dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13tjjAECKgbXV2nU-Rzg_Gqto5v-81YeL?usp=sharing).

Our data collection scripts and metadata system is also available (more details in the repo), which allows you to streamline your data collection framework into one launch command that also associates metadata with it.

Under construction
TODO:
